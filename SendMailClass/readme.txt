The given code defines a class named SendMail, which encapsulates email sending functionality 
for various purposes in a Django project. The class includes methods for sending emails 
related to user registration, verification, password reset, order status, membership invoice, 
and adding staff members. The emails are sent asynchronously using Python's Thread class to 
avoid blocking the main thread during email sending operations. The email content is generated 
by rendering HTML templates using Django's render_to_string function, and the EmailMessage 
class is used to send HTML-formatted emails. The class provides a modular and reusable 
approach for handling different email scenarios within a Django application.
